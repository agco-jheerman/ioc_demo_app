# netcore-ioc-demo

This project is a very basic example of implementing an Inversion-of-Control(IoC) Container pattern for a .net core console app

## Installing .net core
```bash
# Download the latest .net sdk and runtime
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk
```

## Download and install older runtimes
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core

## Build the solution
```bash
# To build and target the .net core 3.1 framework
dotnet build -f netcoreapp3.1

# To build and target the .net core 5.0 framework
dotnet build -f net5.0
```

## Run the solution
```bash
dotnet run
```
